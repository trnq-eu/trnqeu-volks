Everything's an icon these days.
What happened to words and things. How come they somehow blended together into this meaningless, sketchy drawing that doesn't get you neither one or the other. They trick your brain into clicking or sweeping or ignoring like there's nothing else to do in this world.
Shortcuts to nothing, that's what they are. Stupid fucking icons, thought Aguardento, and then he clicked because that's a fucking paper plane and of course you wanna fly it but then you click and nothing flies. If I could put my hands into a real piece of paper, any piece of paper, from a business card to an investigative report, I would make one of those, a real one, with the sharpest point and the strongest wings. And I would fly it, all the way from my desk to the other side of the department, right against the elevator door. With my luck, he thought, doors would open and some handcuffed asshole would be struck right in the eye and I would end up with a brutality complaint. Not my first, he thought, and I tell you what, I wouldn't mind getting another one. But how you even get one of those these days, sitting here, clicking icons. There's no way to be brutal anymore.
