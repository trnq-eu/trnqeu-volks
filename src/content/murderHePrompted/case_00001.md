# Murder, he prompted

Chief Prompter Jameson "Stigowitz" Aguardento dragged and dropped the file into the designated interface and clicked *SEND*.

The detective on the other side of the screen started thinking and analyzing and ruminating on the file while while a rotating circle kept rotating on the screen. Agentic policing, they now call it. Can you believe this shit?, thought Aguardento, where *you* was still himself, or the imaginary listener that he usually impersonated during his workdays, the patient ??? of all his complaints.

At some point the detective asked:

```
How can I help you today, Chief?
```

For Christ's sake, can't you just figure it out, since you're so smart, thought Aguardento.

Sospir√≤, scosse la testa, asking himself if he could believe this shit. 

```
murder
```
, he prompted.
